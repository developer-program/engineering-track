# OWASP Top 10

The OWASP Top 10 is one of many projects by OWASP. It is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security.

It represents a broad consensus about **the most critical security risks to web applications**, i.e. top 10 most frequently used exploits in a website or application.

The OWASP Top 10 document is globally recognised by developers as the **most effective first step towards changing the software development culture within your organisation** into one that produces more secure code. Companies should adopt this document and start the process of ensuring that their web applications minimise these risks.
