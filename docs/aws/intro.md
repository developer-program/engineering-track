## Covers

The intent of the materials is to focus on fundamental concepts of the most common AWS services to start off a career in software development. We will not cover all AWS services and you will need to study a lot more materials to become a skilled Dev Ops or to pass the AWS developer Associate exam.

## Servers around the world

You have the option to choose where to host your application. You can select by Region and Availability Zone. AWS have servers around the world.

### Region

A Region contains different availability zones. A Region contains data centers located geographically near to each other.  When a major failure happens due with the region, a disruption of one region is highly unlikely to affect another.

In AWS, all instances will belong to a region.

Examples of Region code:

- Singapore: `ap-southeast-1`
- Sydney: `ap-southeast-2`
- Oregon: `us-west-2`

### Availability Zone

An availability zone can be think of as a data center. Each AZ is identifiable by the region code follow by letter.

Availability Zone in Singapore(ap-southeast-1)

- ap-southeast-1a
- ap-southeast-1b
- ap-southeast-1c
