# Project Fly

Project fly is a 2 weeks project to simulate an agile development project. Trainees should apply necessary techniques learn during agile training such as to come out with story mapping, priority list and minimal viable product.

## Goal Statement

Project fly is a revolutionary all in one flight booking platform for travellers, check-in officers and airlines staff.

### Travllers

For Traveller, using our application allows them to search for flights across different airlines based on the desired departure, arrival time and price. They can create a personal account and view upcoming flights, flight history and transaction.

### Airline staff

Airline staff often need to check passengers before allow boarding, they will want the capability to view passengers list of the upcoming flight easily.
Flight might also get delayed and details can get change, they should be able to view and change flight details. They can also create, edit, delete bookings made from their airline.
Travellers might contact the airline for modificationÂ or cancellation for their bookings. Airline staff should have the capabilities to change upcoming books from their airline.

### Check-in Officers

To help Check-in Officers find passengers details, they can view all booking details of all airlines of the day and the day after.
