# Git advanced

## Commonly used commands

- Initialise a new git repository
  `git init`
- View modifications made in working dir / View staged files
  `git status`
- Undo modifications to file
  `git checkout <file name>`
- Undo all modifications in working dir
  `git checkout .`
- View details of local changes
  `git diff`
- Add change to staging area
  `git add`
  `git add -p`
- Undo staging changes from specified file
  `git reset <file name>`
- Undo all staged changes
  `git reset .`
- Commit changes in staging to the local repository
  `git commit`
  `git commit -m "commit message here"`

## Commands to view commit history and details

- Show details of a commit
  `git show <commit-sha>`
- Show git commit history list
  `git log`
- Show all branches of commit history title in a graph
  `git log --all --oneline --graph`
- View graphical UI of commit history graph and commit details
  `gitk`

## Commands to modify local commits that have not been pushed

- Make changes to the last commit (eg: add or remove file, edit commit message)
  `git add .`
  `git commit --amend`
- Make changes to the last commit (eg: add or remove file, Do not edit commit message)
  `git add .`
  `git commit --amend --no-edit`
- Undo commits to a certain point in time (changes from commit dumped to working dir)
  `git reset <commit SHA to reset to>`
- Delete commits to a certain point in time (**Warning!!** also deletes any uncommitted changes)
  `git reset --hard <commit SHA to reset to>`
- Rewrite commit history with rebase interactive
  decide what group of commits you would like to rewrite, pick the SHA just before that
  `git rebase -i HEAD~3` to change the last three commit, for example.
- pick the commit if you would like no changes to it
- drop the commit if you would like to delete it
- edit the commit if you would like to amend it
- squash the commit if you would like it to squash to the previous commit

## Commands to undo commits which are already pushed to remote

As we should never modify commits which are already on remote, we can only revert it with a new commit.

- Create a new commit which is the exact opposite of specified commit SHA
  `git revert <SHA>`

## Commands to save local changes temporarily

eg: when you need to pause the feature you are working on, to work on something else urgent

- Saves changes from working dir and staging to stash area
  `git stash`
- Saves changes from working dir and staging area and new files, to stash area
  `git stash -u`
- Save stash with a description
  `git stash save my-awesome-stash`
- Remove last stashed changes and dump them to the working dir
  `git stash pop`
- Remove second last stashed and dump to the working dir
  `git stash pop stash@{1}`
- Dump last stashed to the working dir, but leave stash intact
  `git stash apply`
- List all stashed changes
  `git stash list`

## Working with branches

Best practices: Do a git pull to get the lastest code before creating a branch

- Create branch
  `git branch <branch-name>`
- Switch working dir to specified branch
  `git checkout <branch-name>`
- Create branch and switch to branch (2-in-1 command)
  `git checkout -b <branch name>`
- Delete specified branch
  `git branch -d <branch-name>`
- Force delete specified branch (to delete branch even if it has changes unmerged to master)
  `git branch -D <branch-name>`
