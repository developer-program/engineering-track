# Contributing

Welcome and thank you for wanting to contribute to this project. 

## Task board

We track all tasks on the [task board](https://github.com/developer-program/engineering-track/projects/2). View outstanding tasks that you can pick up and contribute to. Each task is an issue. 

Leave a comment on the task so that we can assign you to it and move the task to the `in-progress` column.

## Infrastructure

For tasks that require an AWS account, please use your own AWS account as we are still in the midst of setting up an AWS account for the project. 

We suggest that you create one with your ThoughtWorks email address and enjoy the free-tier for spikes.
